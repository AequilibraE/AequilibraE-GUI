Installation
============

AequilibraE is available from the QGIS plugin repository, and we recommend you to download using the instructions below.

.. note::
   Although AequilibraE is under intense development, you don't need to expect important API changes, but you should \
   check for new features often.

Installing stable releases
--------------------------

The steps for installing AequilibraE are the same as for any QGIS plugin



Experimental releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you are looking for bleeding edge versions of AequilibraE and are not afraid of a crash here and there (or
want to help by testing these versions), you can do so by checking the box for experimental plugins within the QGIS
plugin manager.

Downloading binaries
--------------------

If you get the message below when you try to run one of AequilibraE's tools, it is because you are missing some files.

The problem is that many of AequilibraE's algorithms rely on compiled extensions, but it is against the QGIS's community
guidelines to upload binaries to the repository.

In order to comply with that rule without losing functionality, we ask you to
download such binaries after installing the QGIS, which can be done in the AequilibraE menu, but it does require
restarting QGIS
