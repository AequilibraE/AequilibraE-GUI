description=Transportation modeling toolbox for QGIS
about=AequilibraE is a transportation modelling toolbox modeled after the standard 4-step modeling process and according to the current state of the practice in transportation modeling. It includes procedures for the creation of node layers from line layers, automatic addition of centroid connectors, algorithms for the computation of desire lines and delaunay lines, computation and display of shortest paths, computation of impedance matrices and other auxiliary tools such as GeoTag (spatial join without creating a third joined layer). Upcoming features include calibration and application of trip distribution models (synthetic gravity and iterative proportional fitting) and traffic assignment. All non-GIS features (assignment, path computation and trip distribution) can be accessed directly from a Python shell.
